        i don't know where to start talking about this. 
        <br>
        my parents have paid for my education for all <br> 
        these years. spent thousands of dollars in these <br> 
        institutions. i just see that this way <br>
        of formal education is bad because it's all about concepts. <br>
    </p>

        i want to do things on my own. start doing things i'm intrested in and just enjoy my time in life. 
        travel from country to country and see the hidden cultures of the world. i believe nothing has 
        passed me. i always have time to make up for everything.
